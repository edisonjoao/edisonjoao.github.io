	<h1> My inspiration </h1>

<p>Hi, I'm everything you see around you. Gen-Us, will be everything you see around you. Founded by Edison JoƒÅo inspired by all of the noise and things that are going around in the Zeitgeist. I want to be the one that is in charge and changes the conversation around Millenials and also around creating a platform for us. </p>
